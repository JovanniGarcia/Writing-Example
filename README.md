# 👋 Welcome!

## Dear Employers,

Hello! Step into my GitHub world, where I'm building my IT collection bit by bit. I've included projects that reflect what I know and love about information technology and cybersecurity.

🛡️ From:
- **Vulnerability assessments**  
- **Threat analysis**  
- **Scripting and coding**  
- **Network security**

Each project represents how I stay current in this fast-moving field and how I enjoy applying classroom concepts in real-world scenarios.

🎯 **What to Expect Here:**
- Ongoing personal projects  
- Problem-solving strategies  
- Technical growth and certifications  
- A clear picture of my dedication to IT & cybersecurity

This profile isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a reflection of my curiosity, commitment, and how I could bring value to your team. I’m just getting started, and I’ll be adding new content regularly, so feel free to check back anytime!

**Thank you for your time and consideration—I’m always open to feedback or opportunities to connect.**

Best regards,
